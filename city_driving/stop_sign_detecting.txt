HANDLING STOP SIGNS

by default, detect_stops is True
if we're detecting stops
    check if a stop sign is visible
    if so, calculate distance to the sign
    approach the stopping distance, similar logic to parking in front of the cone
    once stopped, set detect_stops to False so we start moving again
    once stop sign is no longer visible, set detect_stops to True (may need to change this to be more robust)


for passing info from stop_detector.py -> parking_controller.py, we could either calculate distance with homography
